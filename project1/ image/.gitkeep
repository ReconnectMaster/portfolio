<!--
Here, you can 
add a subfolder named "image" 
inside the project1 folder of your repository. To do this, follow these steps:

Using GitHub Web Interface:
Navigate to your repo at project1.
Click the Add file button, then select Create new file.
In the filename field, type image/.gitkeep (or any filename after image/). This will create the image subfolder.
Add some content (it can be empty), then commit the new file.

Note: 
Git only tracks folders if they contain files, 
so adding an empty file like

/main-folder/.gitkeep 

is a common practice to keep empty folders in your repository.
