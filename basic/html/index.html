You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.

Radio buttons are a type of input.

Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.


Here's an example of a radio button:

<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>
It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the child input element. For example:

<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

Add a pair of radio buttons to your form, each nested in its own label element. One should have the option of indoor and the other should have the option of outdoor. Both should share the name attribute of indoor-outdoor to create a radio group.
------------------------------------------------------
Could be Write a code:
  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    
<label for="indoor"><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
    
<label for="outdoor"><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    
<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
  
</form>

==============================================================================

Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.

Checkboxes are a type of input

Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input and its corresponding label by setting the for attribute on the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.

Here's an example of a checkbox:

<label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
----------------------------
Could be write a code: "The Structure is <label><input type="" name=""> attribute</label>

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    
<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
    
<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    

<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
    
<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    
<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    

<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    

<button type="submit">Submit</button>
  
</form>

</main>

=================================================================================

Default
You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example:

<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>

================================================================================

Could write a code:
 <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    
<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
 <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
  
</form>
</main>

When in the onclick attribute you do not need to specify that it is Javascript.

<button type="button" 
        onclick="window.open('', '_self', ''); window.close();">Discard</button>
